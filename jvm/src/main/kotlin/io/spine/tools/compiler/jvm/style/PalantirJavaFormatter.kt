/**
 * Java style formatter based on Palantir Java Format library.
 *
 * This formatter is currently used instead of [PsiJavaCodeStyleFormatter] which
 * was used before.
 *
 * The reason for migrating to Palantir Java Format is that it is faster.
 * The downside of this switch is that [JavaCodeStyle] options are not applicable.
 * The Palantir formatter, being based on Google Java Code Style formatter, does not
 * allow much of customization apart from the minimal style options passed
 * as an argument to [Formatter.createFormatter] factory function.
